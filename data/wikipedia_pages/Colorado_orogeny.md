The **Colorado orogeny** was an episode of [mountain building](/wiki/Mountain_building "Mountain building") (an _[orogeny](/wiki/Orogeny "Orogeny")_ ) in [Colorado](/wiki/Colorado "Colorado") and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago ([Mya](/wiki/Mya_\(unit\) "Mya \(unit\)")), during the [Paleoproterozoic](/wiki/Paleoproterozoic "Paleoproterozoic") ([Statherian](/wiki/Statherian "Statherian") Period). It is recorded in the **Colorado orogen** , a >500-km-wide belt of [oceanic](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") [arc](/wiki/Volcanic_arc "Volcanic arc") rock that extends southward into [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"). The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger [Yavapai orogeny](/wiki/Yavapai_orogeny "Yavapai orogeny"). 

## Description

The Colorado orogen, formerly called the Colorado [province](/wiki/Province_\(geology\) "Province \(geology\)"), is a >500-km-wide belt of [oceanic](/wiki/Ocean "Ocean") [arc](/wiki/Volcanic_arc "Volcanic arc") rock (1.78–1.65 Ga) that extends southward into [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico") and composes a major part of the [Proterozoic](/wiki/Proterozoic "Proterozoic") provinces of [southwestern United States](/wiki/Southwestern_United_States "Southwestern United States"). This transcontinental collisional event occurred during the [Paleoproterozoic](/wiki/Paleoproterozoic "Paleoproterozoic") ([Statherian](/wiki/Statherian "Statherian") Period).[1] The [Wyoming](/wiki/Wyoming "Wyoming") sector of the Colorado orogeny was formerly called the [Medicine Bow orogeny](/w/index.php?title=Medicine_Bow_orogeny&action=edit&redlink=1 "Medicine Bow orogeny \(page does not exist\)"). The eastern sector extends into the [High Plains](/wiki/High_Plains_\(United_States\) "High Plains \(United States\)") and is called the [Central Plains orogeny](/wiki/Central_Plains_orogeny "Central Plains orogeny"). The boundary between the Colorado orogeny and the [Wyoming craton](/wiki/Wyoming_craton "Wyoming craton") is the [Cheyenne belt](/wiki/Cheyenne_belt "Cheyenne belt"), a 5-km-wide [mylonitic](/wiki/Mylonitic "Mylonitic") [shear zone](/wiki/Shear_zone "Shear zone") that [verges](/wiki/Vergence_\(geology\) "Vergence \(geology\)") northward. The Cheyenne belt transects and cuts off the south edge of the older [Trans-Hudson orogeny](/wiki/Trans-Hudson_orogeny "Trans-Hudson orogeny").[2]

The Paleoproterozoic [volcanic](/wiki/Volcanic_rock "Volcanic rock") and [sedimentary rocks](/wiki/Sedimentary_rocks "Sedimentary rocks") that resulted from the Colorado orogeny underwent [metamorphism](/wiki/Metamorphism "Metamorphism") followed by plastic [folding](/wiki/Fold_\(geology\) "Fold \(geology\)") under moderate pressure and temperature (PT) conditions (temperature about 500 °C and pressures in excess of 1.2 [GPa](/wiki/Pascal_\(unit\) "Pascal \(unit\)")). The metamorphism was accompanied by intrusion of intermediate [calc-alkalic rocks](/wiki/Calc-alkaline_magma_series "Calc-alkaline magma series"), such as the [granodiorites](/wiki/Granodiorite "Granodiorite") of the [Boulder Creek batholith](/w/index.php?title=Boulder_Creek_batholith&action=edit&redlink=1 "Boulder Creek batholith \(page does not exist\)"). The accompanying [amphibolite](/wiki/Amphibolite "Amphibolite") [facies](/wiki/Metamorphic_facies "Metamorphic facies") metamorphism is characterized by [sillimanite](/wiki/Sillimanite "Sillimanite") and, locally, [garnet](/wiki/Garnet "Garnet"), [andalusite](/wiki/Andalusite "Andalusite"), and [cordierite](/wiki/Cordierite "Cordierite"). Contemporaneity of emplacement of the granodioritic rocks with folding is indicated by concordant [plutonic](/wiki/Plutonic "Plutonic") boundaries and by conformity of the internal structure (of [solid-state](/wiki/Solid "Solid") [recrystallization](/wiki/Crystallization "Crystallization")) in the batholith with that in the [supracrustal](/wiki/Supracrustal "Supracrustal") wall rocks. Comparable mineral facies in the country rocks and batholiths indicate that emplacement took place at moderate depths.[1]

As is typical of large orogenies deformation patterns of the Colorado orogeny differ throughout the range. Adjacent to the Cheyenne belt, and extending across a width of at least 150 km to the south, foliation and upright folds predominantly trend westward. In the northern [Front Range](/wiki/Front_Range "Front Range") sector of this region, geologic mapping demonstrated three generations of northwest-trending folds that pre-date the ~1.4 Ga shear zones. Similar fold patterns are present in the northern [Park Range](/wiki/Park_Range_\(Colorado\) "Park Range \(Colorado\)") and [Medicine Bow Mountains](/wiki/Medicine_Bow_Mountains "Medicine Bow Mountains"). These structural [fabrics](/wiki/Fabric_\(geology\) "Fabric \(geology\)") indicate shortening in a north-south direction and can be explained by collision, subsequent subduction, and continued convergence along the Cheyenne belt. Farther south, more distant from the Cheyenne belt, fold patterns differ materially from those in the northernmost part of the Colorado orogeny. In the north-central Front Range, west of [Denver](/wiki/Denver "Denver"), in an area of >2000 km2 that has been mapped in detail the older regional folds mainly bear north-northeast; the folds range from broad open, upright folds to tight, upright folds that plunge gently to moderately northeast. In nearby areas to the east and west, however, the folds of the older orogenic event trend northwest; field observations indicate that these folds apparently are slightly older than the more prevalent north-trending folds, but both generations are part of the older [gneiss](/wiki/Gneiss "Gneiss")-forming episode inasmuch as they are cut by the Boulder Creek batholith. Both sets of these folds indicate shortening events resulting from regional [stress](/wiki/Stress_\(mechanics\) "Stress \(mechanics\)") patterns. Because of the consistency of these fold patterns over relatively large areas, evidence for folding resulting from forceful [intrusion](/wiki/Intrusion "Intrusion") of [igneous](/wiki/Igneous "Igneous") rocks is generally lacking; intrusions of this orogenic event are [synkinematic](/wiki/Kinematics "Kinematics"), as exemplified by the much-studied Boulder Creek batholith.[1]

The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger [Yavapai orogeny](/wiki/Yavapai_orogeny "Yavapai orogeny"), which extended across North America and probably to other continents that were joined to North America as part of the [supercontinent](/wiki/Supercontinent "Supercontinent"), [Columbia](/wiki/Columbia_\(supercontinent\) "Columbia \(supercontinent\)").[3]
